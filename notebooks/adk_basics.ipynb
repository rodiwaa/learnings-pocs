The news_agent also included a weather update for Mumbai for *Saturday, January 31, 2026*, which reported dense smog, unseasonably cold conditions, and a 'severe' Air Quality Index (AQI) of 320, advising residents to limit outdoor exposure due to pollution concerns amidst cloudy and hazy conditions with temperatures between 21°C and 31°C.\n\n### Weather Results\n(Based on weather_agent's findings)\nThe weather_agent provided a forecast for Mumbai for *Sunday, February 1, 2026*, indicating a beautiful day with mostly sunny skies throughout, transitioning to clear conditions at night.
